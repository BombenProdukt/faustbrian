### Hey there! ðŸ¦€

My name is Brian, and I'm a self-taught senior software engineer currently focusing on developer experience and tooling. I'm a big fan of open-source, and I've created several helpful open-source applications and packages, such as [zai](https://github.com/faustbrian/zai), [badge.sh](https://github.com/faustbrian/badge.sh), [Lighty](https://github.com/faustbrian/laravel-lighty), [Lighty API](https://github.com/faustbrian/laravel-lighty-api), [Geoly](https://github.com/faustbrian/geoly-api), and a fair number of [Laravel](https://github.com/faustbrian?q=laravel&type=public&language=&sort=) goodies to take the mundane tasks off your plate. Throughout most of my career, I have worked as a freelance software engineer and consultant for diverse clients worldwide. This role has involved me in the overhaul of departments, products, and teams, the development of API strategies, and providing advice to companies on their technical strategy.

I love learning by doing, and since I began my journey nearly 20 years ago, I have dabbled in a bit of everything: APIs, databases, websites, web applications, desktop applications, mobile applications, low-level programming, command line interfaces, scraping, microservices, browser extensions, blockchainâ€”you name it. While there are many ways to approach software development, I find this one suits my personality best. In contrast, I struggle to follow tutorials or videos when learning new technologies.
